Title: Welcome to Gir.Core
---
Gir.Core is a project which aims to provide C# wrapper for different [GObject] based libraries like [GTK] for user interfaces.

The foucs is not to just wrap the libraries:
* Create a simple and streamlined C# API on top of the low level C API
* Provide an online documentation for the C# API

The long term goal is to create libraries which allow to easily convert C# MVVM applications from Windows to Linux.

Supported libraries
* [GTK] (wip): UI-Toolkit
* [WebKitGTK] (wip): Browser-Engine
* [JavaScriptCore] (planned): Javascript integration for [WebKitGTK]
* [libhandy] (planned): Convergent UI-Widgets for [GTK] to support mobile phones
