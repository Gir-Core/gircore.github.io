Title: Welcome to Gir.Core
---
Gir.Core is a project which aims to provide C# wrapper for different [GObject] based libraries like [GTK] for user interfaces.

The foucs is not to just wrap the libraries:
* Create a simple and streamlined C# API on top of the low level C API
* Provide an online documentation for the C# API

The long term goal is to create libraries which allow to easily convert C# MVVM applications from Windows to Linux.

Currently the focus is set to [GTK] to provide a simple UI-Toolkit for C# on Linux. Later on [libhandy] will be integrated, to support convergent UIs which run on mobile phones, too.
